## Hello Folks ðŸ‘‹

I made a Notes app in which a person can **login/Signup** and can store their Important Notes.\
This is a beginner-friendly small Project but gave you a great understanding of how the server and frontend communicate and work together with the database. 

## How to Run the Project
To Run the project first you need to folk this repository and there you will get to folder
```python

```

Backend - to run the backend you just need to run a few commands that are given below (**Run this in the same directory in which you have forked the repository**)

```
